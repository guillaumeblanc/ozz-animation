ozz-animation is an **open source c++ 3d skeletal animation engine**. It provides runtime character animation playback functionalities (loading, sampling, blending...). It proposes a low-level renderer agnostic and game-engine agnostic implementation, focusing on performance and memory constraints with a data-oriented design.

ozz-animation comes with the toolchain to convert from major Digital Content Creation formats (Fbx, Collada, Obj, 3ds, dxf) to ozz optimized runtime structures. Offline libraries are also provided to implement the conversion from any other animation and skeleton format.
